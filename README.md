## Day 2 (Lines)

This map is built on top of [BlakeRobMills’s] map which can bound on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills/status/1455691876091170820) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/30DayMapChallenge).

I merely added the data and the visualization for Zurich, Switzerland, changed some of the styling, added an R project, hopefully improved some of the code (the original R code didn’t load all necessary libraries, e.g.) and expanded the comments a bit. Kudos go to [BlakeRobMills](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills) for the idea and original execution.
